  Description: "They are durable, have great armor, and provide plenty of damage
    output. Fighters get more Ability Score Increases than any other class, allowing
    them to easily explore feats without sacrificing crucial ability scores. They
    also notably get more attacks than any other class, which can be a lot of fun.
    <br> <br> The core of the class is very simple, but the complexity of the subclasses
    varies significantly. The\_Champion\_adds almost no complexity, while subclasses
    like the\_Eldritch Knight\_can add quite a bit. This makes the Fighter a great
    choice for players of all experience levels and for players with a broad range
    of preferences, allowing you to build a character that you find mechanically
    appealing but without making it more work than you might like."
